# Notion Page Bookmark Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Notion Reading List extension to append bookmarks directly to your Notion pages.

## Prerequisites

1. A Notion account
2. A Notion page where you want to save bookmarks
3. Chrome or Firefox browser

## Step 1: Create a Notion Integration

1. Go to [notion.so/my-integrations](https://notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Click **"+ New integration"**
3. Give your integration a name (e.g., "Reading List Extension")
4. Select the workspace where your target page is located
5. Click **"Submit"**
6. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** (starts with `secret_`)

## Step 2: Get Your Page ID

1. Navigate to the Notion page where you want to save bookmarks
2. Copy the page URL from your browser
3. Extract the page ID - it's the 32-character string after the last dash in the URL

Example URL:
```
https://www.notion.so/My-Reading-List-123abc456def789ghi012jkl345mno67
```
Page ID: `123abc456def789ghi012jkl345mno67`

## Step 3: Share Page with Integration

1. Open your target Notion page
2. Click **"Share"** in the top right
3. Click **"Invite"**
4. Find your integration by name and select it
5. Click **"Invite"**

## Step 4: Configure the Extension

1. Click the extension icon in your browser
2. Click **"Set up Notion"**
3. Enter your **Notion API Key** (the integration token from Step 1)
4. Enter your **Notion Page ID** (from Step 2)
5. Click **"Save Settings"**

The extension will test the connection to ensure everything is configured correctly.

## Using the Extension

1. Navigate to any webpage you want to bookmark
2. Click the extension icon
3. Click **"Add to Notion Page"**
4. The page will be added as a bookmark block to your Notion page

## Troubleshooting

**"Failed to connect to Notion"**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Ensure the page ID is exactly 32 characters
- Check that you've shared the page with your integration

**"Failed to add bookmark"**
- Make sure the integration has edit permissions to the page
- Verify the page still exists and hasn't been deleted
- Try refreshing the extension settings

## Bookmark Format

Bookmarks are added as Notion bookmark blocks containing:
- The webpage URL
- The page title (when available)
- Automatic link preview (generated by Notion)

The bookmarks will appear at the bottom of your specified Notion page.
